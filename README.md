# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
The purpose of this analysis was to create two tables: one to determine the number of employees retiring and their job titles, and the other to determine emplyees who are eligible to participate in the mentorship program. Both tables include first and last names, position tiles, start and end dates

## Results:
From initially looking at the tables, for most of the employees retiring are Senior Engineers, while the rest are Senior Staff, not necessarily Engineers. Among those retiring, there are 1549 emplyees who qualify for the mentorship program. It looks like there are more people retiring than potential mentors if any, hence the company will have to invest in a program that will accomodate that many eligible employees

## Summary:
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
With the 1549 who qualify for the mentorship program, it looks there will be very many roles to be filed. In order to determine this, we will have to group  the potential retirees by years. After determining that, the company can gradually post job postings accordingly

Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees
From the results, it does not seem like there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation, so the company will have to pour into additional resources to accompolish this.
